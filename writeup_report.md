# **Behavioral Cloning Project**

## The goals / steps of this project
* Use the simulator to collect data of good driving behavior
* Build, a convolution neural network in Keras that predicts steering angles from images
* Train and validate the model with a training and validation set
* Test that the model successfully drives around track one without leaving the road
* Summarize the results with a written report

### Files Submitted & Code Quality

#### 1. Submission includes all required files and can be used to run the simulator in autonomous mode

My project includes the following files:
* model.py containing the script to create and train the model
* drive.py for driving the car in autonomous mode
* model.h5 containing a trained convolution neural network
* writeup_report.md summarizing the results

#### 2. Install required python libraries:

My project need a [anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) or [miniconda](https://conda.io/miniconda.html) to use the environment setting.

```python
# Use TensorFlow without GPU
conda env create -f environment.yml

# Use TensorFlow with GPU
conda env create -f environment-gpu.yml
```

Or you can manually install the required libraries (see the contents of the environemnt*.yml files) using pip.

#### 3. Submission includes functional code
Using the Udacity provided simulator and my drive.py file, the car can be driven autonomously around the track by executing
```sh
python drive.py model.h5
```

#### 4. Submission code is usable and readable

The model.py file contains the code for training and saving the convolution neural network. The file shows the pipeline I used for training and validating the model, and it contains comments to explain how the code works.

### Model Architecture and Training Strategy

The design of the network is based on [the NVIDIA model](https://devblogs.nvidia.com/parallelforall/deep-learning-self-driving-cars/), which has been used by NVIDIA for the end-to-end self driving test.  As such, it is well suited for the project.

It is a deep convolution network which works well with supervised image classification / regression problems.  As the NVIDIA model is well documented, I was able to focus how to adjust the training images to produce the best result with some adjustments to the model to avoid overfitting and adding non-linearity to improve the prediction.


I've added the following adjustments to the model.

- I used Lambda layer to normalized input images to avoid saturation and make gradients work better.
- I've added an additional dropout layer to avoid overfitting after the convolution layers.
- I've also included ELU for activation function for every layer except for the output layer to introduce non-linearity.

In the end, the model looks like as follows:

- Image normalization
- Convolution: 5x5, filter: 24, strides: 2x2, activation: ELU
- Convolution: 5x5, filter: 36, strides: 2x2, activation: ELU
- Convolution: 5x5, filter: 48, strides: 2x2, activation: ELU
- Convolution: 3x3, filter: 64, strides: 1x1, activation: ELU
- Convolution: 3x3, filter: 64, strides: 1x1, activation: ELU
- Drop out (0.5)
- Fully connected: neurons: 100, activation: ELU
- Fully connected: neurons:  50, activation: ELU
- Fully connected: neurons:  10, activation: ELU
- Fully connected: neurons:   1 (output)

As per the NVIDIA model, the convolution layers are meant to handle feature engineering and the fully connected layer for predicting the steering angle.  However, as stated in the NVIDIA document, it is not clear where to draw such a clear distinction.  Overall, the model is very functional to clone the given steering behavior.

The below is an model structure output from the Keras which gives more details on the shapes and the number of parameters.

## Data Preprocessing

### Image Sizing

- the images can be resized to other size so that the model wonâ€™t be trained with the sky and the car front parts, but I used the original size.
- the images are normalized (image data divided by 127.5 and subtracted 1.0).  As stated in the Model Architecture section, this is to avoid saturation and make gradients work better)

## Model Training

### Image Augumentation

For training, I used the following augumentation technique along with Python generator to generate unlimited number of images:

- Randomly choose right, left or center images.
- For left image, steering angle is adjusted by +0.2
- For right image, steering angle is adjusted by -0.2
- Randomly flip image left/right
- Randomly translate image horizontally with steering angle adjustment (0.002 per pixel shift)
- Randomly translate image virtically
- Randomly added shadows
- Randomly altering image brightness (lighter or darker)

Using the left/right images is useful to train the recovery driving scenario.  The horizontal translation is useful for difficult curve handling (i.e. the one after the bridge).

## Training, Validation and Test

I splitted the images into train and validation set in order to measure the performance at every epoch.  Testing was done using the simulator.

As for training,

- I used mean squared error for the loss function to measure how close the model predicts to the given steering angle for each image.
- I used Adam optimizer for optimization with learning rate of 1.0e-4 which is smaller than the default of 1.0e-3.  The default value was too big and made the validation loss stop improving too soon.
- I used ModelCheckpoint from Keras to save the model only if the validation loss is improved which is checked for every epoch.

## Outcome

The model can drive the course without bumping into the side ways, and the vidio run1.mp4 show my track.
